Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of how you might design and create the necessary tables in MySQL for your statistics-oriented movie application. We’ll tackle each table in logical order and include explanatory notes on why certain columns or constraints are included. 

---

## 1. `production_company` Table

### Purpose:
Holds information about each production company. Since a movie can be produced by one (or multiple) production companies, this table will be referenced by the `movie` table.

### Suggested Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE production_company (
    production_company_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name                  VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    founded_year          YEAR,
    headquarters_location VARCHAR(255),
    -- Example of a statistics-related column:
    total_movies_produced INT DEFAULT 0,
    -- Additional columns as needed...

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`production_company_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`**  
   - A unique identifier for each production company.
2. **`name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`**  
   - The production company’s name. 
3. **`founded_year YEAR`**  
   - The year the company was founded (could be helpful for statistics based on company age).
4. **`headquarters_location VARCHAR(255)`**  
   - Where the company is headquartered.
5. **`total_movies_produced INT DEFAULT 0`**  
   - A simple statistic: how many total movies a company has produced. Could be updated via triggers or application logic.
6. **Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`)**  
   - Useful for tracking when records are created or updated.

## 2. `country` Table

### Purpose:
Stores data about countries. A movie might be produced in or associated with a specific country, or the production company might operate out of a certain country.

### Suggested Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE country (
    country_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name       VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    iso_code   VARCHAR(3),     -- e.g., "USA", "FRA"
    region     VARCHAR(255),
    -- Example statistics:
    population BIGINT,
    gdp        DECIMAL(15,2),

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`country_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`**  
   - Unique identifier for each country.
2. **`name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`**  
   - Name of the country.
3. **`iso_code VARCHAR(3)`**  
   - Standard 2- or 3-letter country code (e.g., “US”, “FRA”). 
4. **`region VARCHAR(255)`**  
   - The continent or region (e.g., “North America”, “Europe”).
5. **`population BIGINT`, `gdp DECIMAL(15,2)`**  
   - Possible statistics that might be relevant in a data analytics scenario.
6. **Timestamps**  
   - As above, for record tracking.

## 3. `movie` Table

### Purpose:
Contains the core details about each movie (title, release date, production company, etc.) along with some statistics columns relevant to your analytics application.

**Note**: This table references both `production_company` and `country`, so those must be created first (which we did above).

### Suggested Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE movie (
    movie_id                INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title                   VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    release_date            DATE,
    production_company_id   INT,
    country_id              INT,
    runtime_minutes         INT,
    -- Statistics columns (as examples):
    budget                  DECIMAL(15,2),
    box_office              DECIMAL(15,2),
    average_rating          DECIMAL(3,2),
    rating_count            INT,
    total_tickets_sold      INT,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    -- Foreign Key Constraints
    CONSTRAINT fk_movie_production_company
        FOREIGN KEY (production_company_id)
        REFERENCES production_company(production_company_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,

    CONSTRAINT fk_movie_country
        FOREIGN KEY (country_id)
        REFERENCES country(country_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`movie_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`**  
   - Uniquely identifies each movie.
2. **`title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`**  
   - The title of the movie.
3. **`release_date DATE`**  
   - Helps with chronological analytics (e.g., you can filter or group by release year).
4. **`production_company_id INT`**  
   - Links each movie to a production company if applicable.
5. **`country_id INT`**  
   - Indicates the primary country of production (or release).
6. **Statistics Columns**  
   - **`budget`**, **`box_office`**: Financial statistics.  
   - **`average_rating`**, **`rating_count`**: You might store rating information if you track ratings from users or critics.  
   - **`total_tickets_sold`**: Another statistic that can be used for analysis (e.g., viewer popularity).
7. **Foreign Keys**  
   - Ensures referential integrity with `production_company` and `country`.  
   - Used `ON DELETE SET NULL` to avoid deleting movies if a production company or country record is removed—depends on business logic.

## 4. `actor` Table

### Purpose:
Holds information about actors. Because an actor can appear in multiple movies (and a movie can have multiple actors), we have a many-to-many relationship that will be implemented via the `movie_actor` join table.

### Suggested Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE actor (
    actor_id       INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name     VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth  DATE,
    nationality    VARCHAR(100),
    -- Statistics columns (as examples):
    total_movies   INT DEFAULT 0,
    awards_won     INT DEFAULT 0,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`actor_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`**  
   - Unique identifier for each actor.
2. **`first_name`, `last_name`**  
   - Basic name details.
3. **`date_of_birth`, `nationality`**  
   - Optional, but can be valuable for analytics and filtering.
4. **Statistics Columns**  
   - **`total_movies`**: Could be updated as more roles are added.  
   - **`awards_won`**: Simple count of awards an actor has received—again, purely for statistical/analytic purposes.

---

## 5. `movie_actor` Table (The Many-to-Many Join)

### Purpose:
Implements the many-to-many relationship between `movie` and `actor`. This table references both the `movie` table and the `actor` table.

### Suggested Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE movie_actor (
    movie_id INT NOT NULL,
    actor_id INT NOT NULL,
    role     VARCHAR(255),
    -- You could also store additional statistics or metadata here:
    -- e.g., "screen_time_minutes", "billing_order", etc.

    PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, actor_id),

    CONSTRAINT fk_movie_actor_movie
        FOREIGN KEY (movie_id)
        REFERENCES movie(movie_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,

    CONSTRAINT fk_movie_actor_actor
        FOREIGN KEY (actor_id)
        REFERENCES actor(actor_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Composite Primary Key** (`movie_id`, `actor_id`)  
   - Ensures that each `(movie_id, actor_id)` pair is unique (i.e., you don’t insert duplicate entries for the same actor in the same movie).
2. **`role VARCHAR(255)`**  
   - A place to store the name or description of the character the actor plays.
3. **Foreign Keys**  
   - **`movie_id`** references `movie(movie_id)`.  
   - **`actor_id`** references `actor(actor_id)`.  
   - `ON DELETE CASCADE` is common here—if a movie is removed, it also removes all related records in `movie_actor`.

---

## Putting It All Together

Below is a potential order of creation that ensures foreign key dependencies are met without errors:

1. **Create `production_company`**  
2. **Create `country`**  
3. **Create `movie`** (which references `production_company` and `country`)  
4. **Create `actor`**  
5. **Create `movie_actor`** (which references both `movie` and `actor`)

## Summary of the Design

- **`production_company`**: Stores data about production companies.  
- **`country`**: Stores data about countries (which can be linked to movies or companies, if desired).  
- **`movie`**: Main table for storing movie details along with statistical columns (budget, box office, ratings, etc.). References `production_company` and `country`.  
- **`actor`**: Stores data about actors, including some potential stats (e.g., total movies, awards).  
- **`movie_actor`**: Resolves the many-to-many relationship between `movie` and `actor`, storing what role the actor played in each movie.  

The schema is designed with statistical analysis in mind, so we’ve included columns such as `box_office`, `budget`, `average_rating`, `rating_count`, and `awards_won`. You can expand or modify these columns based on your exact analytics needs (e.g., adding columns for streaming views, social media metrics, etc.).

This step-by-step approach should give you a solid foundation to build upon for your movie statistics application.
